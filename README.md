# Sendle Front End Developer take home exercise

**DO NOT FORK THIS REPOSITORY IN GITHUB, CLONE IT AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSION AT THE END OF THE README**

Hi, thanks for completing the front end developer take home exercise

The purpose of this exercise is for us to get a sense of your skill level with CSS,
JavaScript, and React and to see how you think and your approach to solving problems.

The problem we've chosen is a quoting tool, similar to what exists on
in Sendle. This will involve working with Sendle's quoting API to fetch
data

pricing system, since we have one of those at Sendle.
We're also trying to mimic what it's like to calculate a price for
the delivery of a parcel, since we also do that quite extensively. So hopefully it gives
you a flavour for some of the problems you might work on at Sendle.

* Write as many additional tests and classes as you feel you need.
* It's up to you to define the data structures used
* Feel free to use any additional packages you think will help. Of course, the goal here is to show us clean, readable code and allow
  us to see that you have maintainability and correctness at the forefront of your thinking, so keep
  that in mind.

Good luck, have fun.

## The Brief

## Getting Started

This application has been bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/). We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), but this should work with npm if that's your preference.

```
yarn start
yarn run test
```

## Submitting your work

When you have completed the exercise and wish to submit your work, please do the following:

1. Make sure all your work is commited to your branch, good commit messages and telling a story
   through the commits is a good thing.
2. Zip up the folder containing your repo and send to either your recruitment contact or jobs@sendle.com.

**DO NOT PUSH THE REPO UP TO GITHUB OR CREATE A PULL REQUEST AGAINST THIS REPO.**
